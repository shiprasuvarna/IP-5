Forms-
• The <form> element is used to create the structure for the contact form. It 
contains input fields for the user's name, email, and message. 
<label for="name">Name:</label> 
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" required> 
<label for="email">Email:</label> 
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required> 
<label for="message">Message:</label> 
<textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" required></textarea> 
• These are the form input fields where users can enter their name, email, 
and message. The name attribute is used to identify the form fields when 
submitting the form. 
• The submit button is part of the form and is used to trigger the form 
submission when clicked. 
Events-
• An event listener is added to the form to listen for the submit event. When 
the user clicks the submit button or presses Enter while in an input field, 
this event is triggered. 
• e.preventDefault(); is used to prevent the default form submission 
behavior, which would cause the page to refresh. const name = 
contactForm.querySelector('#name').value; const email = 
contactForm.querySelector('#email').value; const message = 
contactForm.querySelector('#message').value; 
• Inside the form submission event handler, JavaScript is used to access the 
values entered by the user in the name, email, and message fields. These 
values are stored in variables for further processing. 
• Email validation is performed using a regular expression emailRegex to 
ensure that the email address entered by the user is in the correct format. 
• If the email format is not valid, an error message is displayed, and the form 
submission is prevented. 
• If there is an error in the form data, an error message is displayed to the 
user using the textContent property of the <p> element with the id 
errormessage. 
• The keyboard event is used when the user interacts with the form by 
pressing the "Submit" button. In this event listener, e.preventDefault() is 
used to prevent the default form submission behavior when the user presses 
Enter or clicks the submit button. This prevents the page from refreshing.
• The mouse event is used when the user interacts with the form by clicking 
the "Submit" button. In this event listener, the function is triggered when 
the user clicks the "Submit" button, which is a mouse event -->
